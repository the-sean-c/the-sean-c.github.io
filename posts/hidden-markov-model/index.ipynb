        "Sometimes one model of the world won't do. Often, we try to fit a well-known model to some observations we have made, and just doesn't fit. Here we will look at the particular situation where observations are generated by several distributions using a mechanism known as a Hidden Markov Model (HMM).\n",
        "\n",
        "Below, we will look at what a Hidden Markov Model is, with a basic example. Then we will create a model to simulate the S&P500. The model does a fairly good job of picking out the major panics of the past 150 years. Interestingly, it indicates that the chance of slipping into a panic in any given month over the period was about 1%. Finally, we will use the model to create some simulations, showing that these models have some advantages in being able to incorporate the risk of a severely negative event that Gaussian models by themselves cannot.\n",

You could imagine a call center with a helpful and an unhelpful representative, the results of reaching one will be better than the results of reaching the other.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, with *Hidden* Markov Models, it is not quite as easy as working with call center representatives, as we will not get to know who is on the other line. All we get are the results, and we have to try and piece together the details of which representative we got based on the outcomes we saw, and then try to model the distribution of outcomes for each of them.\n",
