I started a job recently as an AI Program Manager, so I've been trying to distill the key elements to describe what a successful AI product would have. 

It's a pretty tough thing to do. It's tough because AI is like a lot of things in the corporate world, there's a sort of surficial understanding of what things are, but when you dig into the details it usually turns out that different people understand them to be completely different things. One example of this is the term "market segment". It obviously makes sense that market segments are subjective, but you'd be surprised how many people in the same firm, in different roles, have a different idea of what a market segment is or should be.

This doesn't matter to me at all in my daily life, but try to actually build something means I have to nail these ideas down.

## What is AI?

I've given the talk many times about how AI is a blanket term that can cover statistical, machine-learning and rule-based systems that can do tasks that people would have had to do in the past. It's pretty clear though, that when regular people say AI they're talking about some kind of human-like entity that's able to do a bunch of very smart things really quickly, and achieve some aim that the user wanted to get done in a kind of magical way. 

There's concepts in software engineering of "procedural" v. "declarative" programming. Procedural programming involves setting out all the steps to achieve a particular goal. It's what you do with excel: you set up a bunch of calculations, then when you change one of the inputs the calculations work themselves out one-by-one to give you the answer. It works great, but it requires you to set up the calculation ahead of time. Declarative programming only requires you to say what your goals and inputs are: the computer works out the rest.

So I'm going to say that **AI is a machine that gives me what I want based on a short description of my goals and some input data.**

## What is a good AI product

I've played around with these ideas quite a bit, and I think the elements of an AI product have to consider the following, in order of priority:

- Business Problem
- User Experience
- Data
- AI System

### Business Problem

Why do we set up a situation where we pit solutions against problems? Why not just put products into the world if they seem like they make sense? Well, it turns out that phrasing a product as a solution to a problem allows you to phrase a hypothesis that can be tested. Here is an example:

    - **Problem**: We assume that our current customer management processes are inadequate, leading to inconsistent customer experiences, missed sales opportunities, and inefficient operations. 
    - **Solution**: We believe that implementing a CRM will allow client service staff to access a common source of knowledge about the client relationship, leading to a more consistent client experience; it will help to identify opportunities for cross-selling, and for re-prospecting old clients; and will help streamline operations.
    - **Metrics**: We believe that this will result in a decline in client churn by 5% per year, and an increase in cross-selling of 10% per year.

Now, we can actually test our assumptions one by one, using surveys, interviews, protoypes etc., for both the problem and then the solution. metrics are an important part of the process, as these will help to define whether the product is delivering value for the business.

<!-- Most decently large organizations will have some kind of process that uses business cases for project approval. The purpose of a business case is quite logical: to spell out the benefits of a project and how it will outweigh the costs. As a process, starting ab initio, it makes sense as a way to think about a project. I have come to see relying on them for project approval to be problematic though, for example^[Please note that I am in favor of CRMs when they are part of a broader strategic plan to use the data they aggregate for analytics, marketing etc.!]:

- They are often a means to justify a solution, e.g. "implementing a CRM will solve our problem of having no CRM".
- Impacts to revenue and expenses are impossible to estimate. Especially when businesses don't know how much a specific task generates or costs. How do you answer a question like "how much of our revenue is due to post meeting note-taking and note sharing, and how much does making and sharing notes cost us".
- The loop is never closed after a project is complete. Did the project generate revenue or cut expenses? Was that 5% growth in revenue due to a new CRM or did the sales team work harder? If the sales team hires more office admin staff to enter data into the CRM, is that expense considered?

The way forward instead, I think, is to follow a lean innovation methodology. It's not perfect, but I like the Lean Innovation Guide by David Griesbach. He lays out a fairly simple scheme:

In many ways, this does in face follow the ideals of the business case, but instead of making approval of a project dependent on a fully planned project, you build prototypes and iterate on the product to let it speak for itself. If the product makes sense, people will let you know: they will literally call you and ask you how it's going.

Following a lean product development cycle with prototyping to prove out value in the organization is also a way of managing the risk of innovation th

### User Experience

It's hard for me to say this because I'm a statistics, machine learning, data guy, but **the clear priority is User Experience**. Why? Because if nobody is using the thing you made, then you've wasted a bunch of time. When I was researching this a little while ago, I came across Peter Morville's User Experience Honeycomb^[https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-experience.html]. According to him, a product has a good user experience when it is:

- Useful: Fulfills a need - a need which is not already being met.
- Usable: Easy to understand and navigate
- Desirable: Branding etc. makes you feel like you want to use it.
- Findable: Easy to find product, easy to find what you need
- Accessible: Considerate of people with disabilities.
- Credible: Users can trust the information they are told.
